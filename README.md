# React Text Analyzer

Check it out live 👉 https://char-count-app.vercel.app/

A short and fun project I built to learn the fundamentals of React. It’s simple, interactive, and perfect for getting comfortable with core concepts like state, props, and event handling.

## 🚀 What It Does

This app analyzes the text you type and shows you:

-- Character Count

-- Space Count

-- Word Count

-- Sentence Count

All counts update instantly as you type!

## 💡 Why I Built This

I wanted a small, hands-on project to understand how React works — how components communicate, how state updates, and how user input is handled. This was a great way to practice those basics while making something useful!

🛠 Built With

-- React

-- Tailwind CSS

-- Deployed on Vercel
